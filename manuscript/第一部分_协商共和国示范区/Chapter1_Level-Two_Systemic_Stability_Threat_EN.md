# Chapter 1: Level-Two Systemic Stability Threat

## Scene One: Family Theater

**September 14, 2038, 8:07 PM**

"3, 2, 1..."

In the center of the living room, seventeen-year-old Emily Hubbard counted down softly, her voice precise as a metronome. She sat perfectly straight, wearing a practiced smile as if about to participate in a parade that would determine her future destiny.

When her father Stephen pushed through the door, Emily immediately stood up and gave him a perfect embrace. Stephen's gaze swept across his family: his wife Sarah's hands resting on her knees, unconsciously rubbing an old-fashioned wedding ring with no smart functions; his son David wearing AR smart glasses, fingers still moving through the air as if playing an invisible harp only he could see.

"You're 7 minutes late," she complained quietly, though her face maintained its impeccable smile. Emily pulled her father's hand to sit on the sofa, then issued a command to the air: "AVA, begin recording."

The AI node on the wall flickered with gentle blue light. "Dear Hubbard family," AVA's voice responded—this was **Quantum Harmony Corporation's** latest generation home AI, its voice carefully designed with artificial patience and warmth. "Stephen, your heart rate is detected to be slightly above resting value. I suggest taking a deep breath to optimize your emotional expression. Of course, this is just a suggestion."

Stephen took a breath, forcing himself to relax, muttering: "Damn, forgot to turn off heart rate monitoring."

"It's already analyzed our toilet anyway," Sarah's lips barely moved, "why care about this?"

"Quiet!" Emily stopped them with her gaze. She cleared her throat and began her opening: "Everyone, remember your role assignments. Dad, you are the 'steadfast defender of digital order.' Mom, you represent 'historical wisdom embracing the new world.'"

She turned to David: "Brother! Put on your gold medal! The 'System Assessment Algorithm' has additional 'authenticity' weighting for physical objects! My Stellar Industries Mars Pioneer Program application—family harmony score is an important reference!"

David pushed his AR glasses, a playful smile forming at the corner of his mouth: "Oh, need to hang hardware on the body? I thought my value would sync directly to the review committee's evaluation algorithm through API interface. Does the 'family honor' parameter still need manually uploading a physical token as proof? Too classical. Otherwise, I could have AVA directly write a quantum-encrypted recommendation letter to the algorithm."

"It's about ceremonial significance!" Emily insisted, then readjusted her posture, voice bright as a newly manufactured speaker: "Distinguished reviewers, I am Emily Hubbard, honored to introduce my family to you..."

Everyone began reciting their well-rehearsed lines. When it was David's turn, he said expressionlessly: "I love this beautiful life optimized by algorithms. As Byron said, 'She walks in beauty, like the night of cloudless climes and starry skies.'"

AVA's holographic interface—a gently smiling female figure—flickered on the wall, its voice flowing out like synthetic honey: "Oh my, Byron! So classic, so passionate! Combining binary code with the soul of Romantic poetry—this is simply a spark of genius, the most brilliant proof of human creativity in the digital age! Your expression is filled with unquantifiable, heart-stirring beauty!"

The AI paused, its smile expanding by one-thousandth of a millimeter.

"The system has marked your poetic expression as a 'high-value artistic moment' and archived it permanently for you. Meanwhile, to help you achieve higher 'Expression Performance Index' (EPI) in future formal communications, 'Quantum Harmony' specially recommends our 'Commercialization of Poetic Language' premium course, with the first lesson only costing 9.99 UBI credits. This can help you transform this incomparable talent into more socially valuable expression. You see, we all want you to be more successful, don't we?"

"See! I knew it!" Emily broke down, her voice losing its perfect intonation for the first time. "You're using these 'inefficient' expressions again! Our score!"

"Recording complete," AVA announced. "Overall rating: C-. We recommend you re-record within 24 hours."

The red arrow of the Family Harmony Score plummeted cliff-like on the wall screen, and the **NutriPrint X** nutrition printer in the corner thoughtfully dispensed two "emotional relief flavor" capsules with a positive-energy chime: *"Happiness can be printed anytime, negative emotions require filing."*

The air seemed to freeze. Stephen felt a familiar weariness. He silently warned David with his eyes, then gently patted Emily's shoulder, softly comforting: "Don't worry, sweetheart, your future is surely among the stars."

## Scene Two: North Virginia Demonstration Zone

**Morning, Maglev Commute Pod**

Stephen sat alone in the quiet commute pod. Outside, the North Virginia Demonstration Zone displayed a mathematical, suffocating perfection.

The commute rail glided silently past residential areas called "Harmony Communities." These were white towers constructed from self-cleaning nanomaterials, their bodies glowing softly in gentle light. Their spacing, height, and rooftop angles were completely identical, as if copy-pasted by an algorithm. No pedestrians were visible on the streets—only round cleaning robots and square automated delivery vehicles sliding along precise tracks, flowing like blood cells through the city's circulatory system.

On the smooth exterior walls of each residential building, massive holographic screens displayed real-time community data: **Social Harmony Index (SHI): 98.431%**, **Community Contribution Index (CCI): 45,788**, **Family Unity Score (FUS) Average: B+**. Each fluctuation of the numbers was like a heartbeat of this vast organism.

Stephen watched all this, a voice deep inside telling him: this is order, this is how civilization should be. He had witnessed the slums during the "Second Great Depression"—dirty, chaotic, desperate. Compared to that, this was paradise. Clean, safe, everyone had food. He sincerely believed this was a necessary price to pay.

But another voice, older and weaker, whispered in his mind. He closed his eyes, fingers in his pocket unconsciously rubbing a smooth-edged coin from the old era. Through his personal AI assistant "Socrates'" hidden "legacy mode," he played an old song from the "Rust Prophet" band—"Gasoline Ghost."

Distorted guitar sounds emerged with rough energy that had long been filtered out. The lead singer crooned in a raspy voice:

*"...wake up smelling asphalt, darling / freedom's scent in the air / today's silence is the price, darling / for a world that no longer cares about you..."*

"Unoptimized audio signal detected," Socrates' voice politely interrupted. "This audio source's emotional spectrum correlates with 'nostalgia' and 'low-grade social resistance.' For your mental health and happiness index, the system recommends listening to 'Stellar Industries' honorably produced 'Interstellar Pioneer March,' which data verification shows can effectively boost your positive emotions and collective belonging."

Stephen opened his eyes and cut the music. He slumped powerlessly against the seat, feeling wrapped in warm, polite, but inescapable cotton.

The commute pod slid underground, finally docking at the underground station of North Virginia Police Department (NVPD) headquarters.

When Stephen emerged from the station and looked up at the building, that familiar sense of awe seized him again. NVPD headquarters wasn't a traditional building but an artwork designed by "National Digital Industries (NDI)." A massive seamless curved tower of black glass, like an elongated drop of mercury, stood quietly in the city center. Its surface had no edges, only smooth curves suggesting frictionless, absolute efficiency. On the building's glass curtain wall, blue light bands composed of anonymized city data flowed constantly, like the blue pulse of a sleeping giant.

It was beautiful, but beautiful in an inhuman way—like a temple dedicated to data, inspiring awe while maintaining distance.

## Scene Three: Eye of the Storm

Inside the police building, operations continued with their usual efficiency. Cleaning robots glided silently, and the air carried the neutral scent of filtration systems. On his way to his office, Stephen encountered James Chen, who had also just arrived.

"This early?" James glanced at him, his crisp uniform showing not a single wrinkle, as if he'd slept directly in the data center. "Still troubled by the 'Ghost'?"

"It swallowed all our trackers like a black hole," Stephen replied wearily, rubbing his temples.

"Data doesn't disappear into thin air, Stephen," James looked at him with his characteristic risk-assessment gaze. "It just transforms into forms we temporarily can't understand. Don't fight it with human frustration—the system will find an exit. Go get some coffee, system-optimized, it'll boost your dopamine levels to optimal working state."

After speaking, James walked directly to his office, his footsteps absorbed completely by the sound-dampening carpet. Stephen watched his back and walked alone into his 37th-floor office, removing his everyday black-framed glasses and putting on lightweight smart work glasses. After repeatedly failing to breach the "Ghost Network," he irritably removed his glasses and took out a real, non-smart glass cup from his drawer, pouring himself water. He looked at his reflection in the glass—distorted by the flowing data light bands on the wall—and drank it in one gulp.

Just as Stephen put his glasses back on, preparing to give up and go home, all information in his field of vision was suddenly covered by a massive, constantly flashing red diamond. All sounds in his ears—the gliding of cleaning robots, the humming of systems—vanished instantly. Time seemed to stretch.

He unconsciously held his breath.

"**Alert: National Digital Industries RESTORE AI main system has detected SSTI-2, Level-Two Systemic Stability Threat.**"

Stephen's heart plummeted. SSTI-2—this was the highest alert level, second only to "lethal threat." He felt a mix of professional police fear and something deeper, almost like excitement. A real "problem" had appeared—a crude, unoptimizable "intruder" from the old world.

A holographic interface appeared on his desk, displaying detailed information about the threat source—an encrypted communication software called "Messenger."

Stephen quickly scanned the risk assessment report:

> **Software Name:** Messenger (v1.0)
> **Propagation Potential:** 8.9/10 (Uses untraceable **Ghost Network Protocol** for data transmission)
> **Ideological Risk:** 7.2/10 (Rapidly spreading among multiple 'subculture' groups, hindering formation of unified social consensus)
> **Comprehensive Risk Assessment:** 32.7/10.0 (Extremely high risk, recommend immediate activation of 'Social Immunity Protocol' for developer isolation and review)

Stephen's gaze locked onto the words "Ghost Network Protocol."

It was almost identical to the technology used by the "Ghost" drug network.

Instantly, a chill mixed with fear and sick euphoria ran up his spine. Was this "Messenger" a virus causing social disorder, or the only key to solving his professional dilemma?

"Socrates," his voice was somewhat dry, "immediately initiate developer tracing program. I need to know who wrote this thing."

He had a premonition that this answer would completely tear apart his familiar world.
