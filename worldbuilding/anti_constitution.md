The People shall govern

Delivered by a Free Citizen of the American Union — July 4th, 2036

“Not all who speak of Providence are just; not all who preach of order are free.”

---

Seven years ago, upon the ruins of trust and the ashes of failing systems, they raised a new banner.
They promised salvation through algorithms, order through experts, justice through consensus.
Today, we gather not to praise their order—but to mourn our lost freedom.

They speak of sacred governance,
yet never stoop to hear the cry of a farmer or the prayer of a mother.
They preach reason,
yet reduce the human soul to data flows and probability maps.
They declare consensus,
yet stamp dissent with the mark of “unfit.”
They invoke divine order,
yet long abandoned divine rights.

This is not the rebirth of the Republic.
This is its betrayal.

They tell us:
The people are too ignorant to govern themselves.
Liberty is too chaotic to endure.
God grants power to the qualified, not the governed.

But we say:

Liberty, though messy, is priceless.
Truth, though disputed, is sacred.
Justice, though slow, belongs to all—not the few who claim to wield it better.

Democracy is not perfect.
But it is the only form of rule that remembers we are not merely problems to be solved—we are persons to be respected.

We do not need self-anointed priests of reason to think for us.
We do not need artificial minds to cleanse politics of its human soul.
We do not need a sterile constitution to replace our conscience.

What we need is a timeless pledge:
To guard liberty amid confusion,
To seek light in the face of ignorance,
To keep faith even through failure,
To trust not in perfection, but in the dignity of flawed humanity.

So today we declare:

The Consensus Republic does not represent justice.
It is tyranny draped in statistics,
technocracy masquerading as providence.
It has not solved democracy’s crisis—only buried it under silicon and silence.

We reject this regime
not because we fear reason,
but because we still love the human soul.
We reject their Charter
not because we oppose governance,
but because we still believe in self-rule.

Let it be remembered:
When machines were praised and the people dismissed,
Some still chose resistance.
Some still fought for the soul.
Some still refused to be managed.

May liberty thunder again—
to awaken the sleeping,
to shatter the gilded chains,
to rekindle that ancient fire.

---

In the name of liberty—misunderstood, but never forgotten.
In defense of a Republic—flawed, but still alive.
We declare: The people shall govern. Not machines. Not managers. Not myths.

自由人民宣言（The People shall govern）

Delivered by a Free Citizen of the American Union, July 4, 2036

“Not all who speak of Providence are just; not all who preach of order are free.”

---

七年前，他们在废墟上立起一面新旗，宣称要以算法之名拯救人民，以专家之手铸造正义，以共识之术重建共和国。今日，我们在此集会，不是为了庆祝他们的秩序，而是为了哀悼我们失落的自由。

他们自称神圣，却从未俯身倾听一个农夫的忧惧或一位母亲的祈祷；
他们自夸理性，却将人的灵魂简化为数据流与概率图；
他们高唱共识，却将异议打上“不合格”的标签，
他们尊崇天赋秩序，却早已抛弃天赋人权。

这不是共和国的再生，这是共和国的背叛。

他们说，人民太愚昧，不能自治；
他们说，自由太混乱，不能维持秩序；
他们说，神明授权了专家，而非人民。

但我们说：
自由并不因混乱而无价值；
真理并不因众声喧哗而黯淡；
正义并不因效率之名而让位于服从。

民主从来不是完美制度，却是唯一尊重人之尊严的制度。它的力量不在于其速度，而在于其源头——人民自己。

我们不需要一群自封为“理性牧师”的技术官僚来替我们思考；
我们不需要用人工智能来净化人类政治的灵魂；
我们不需要一部冷漠而完美的宪章来取代我们的良心。

我们需要的，是一项不灭的誓言：
在混乱中守护自由，
在愚昧中追求光明，
在失败中不忘信仰，
在历史面前，仍敢自决。

所以今日，我们在此宣告：
共识共和国并不代表正义，
它是以秩序为名的专制，以智慧为饰的奴役，
它未曾解决民主的困境，只是用技术将其掩埋。

我们拒绝这一政体，不是因为我们惧怕理性，而是因为我们热爱人性。
我们拒绝这套新宪法，不是因为我们反对治理，而是因为我们相信自治。

让后人记住，
在算法之神被高举、在人民被边缘的时代，
仍有人选择了反抗，仍有人为灵魂而战，仍有人没有被“合理性”征服。

愿自由再次如雷贯耳，唤醒沉睡之民，击碎镀金的枷锁，重燃那古老的火炬。
