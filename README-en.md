# Republic of Consensus: Glory and Dreams of the New World

> *"Seeking order in chaos, reaching consensus in disagreement, achieving unity in diversity."*

A political black comedy novel exploring AI-era governance philosophy.

## Project Overview

*Republic of Consensus* is a political black comedy novel that explores fundamental questions of AI-era governance philosophy through the fictional **American Consensus Republic (ACR)** and the **Confederacy of American Free States (CAFS)**. It delves into the civilizational cold war between these two entities, asking: when elites with disruptive technological power, weary of the old world's inefficiency and irrationality, exercise power under the guise of "rational authoritarianism," what is the value of democracy? What remains of human dignity and free will?

### Creative Features
- **Political Black Comedy**: Depicting the absurd "rationality" with the most serious, objective, and calm brushstrokes. Allowing the system (AI and officials) to defend itself with flawless, logically consistent language, thereby highlighting the underlying oppression and absurdity.
- **Institutional Reflection**: Exploring the possibilities of different governance models, without providing definitive answers, guiding readers to ponder for themselves.
- **Philosophical Inquiry**: Examining the relationship between technology and human nature, and the future of democratic values, personal choice, and human dignity under "benevolent authoritarianism."
- **AI-Assisted Creation**: This project adopts a **human-led, AI-assisted** creative approach.
